  Stories</span></b><span lang=EN> </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN>A grown up girl used to be terrified at the sight of a house
  lizard. She would scream aloud shivering with fear, as if an emergency
  situation had arisen. She was given a few doses of Rock Rose, a flower remedy
  for extreme fright. After a few days she herself killed a lizard, just to
  show that she is not afraid of it any more! </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN>A boy in his teens, studying I PUC, was in a state of
  confusion. He was unable to decide on the course of study to pursue after his
  PUC. Everyday he would come out with an option, only to change it on the
  following day. This state of mind pervaded into his studies and other
  activities as well. He is the only son to his parents and obviously they were
  worried. He was given a few doses of Scleranthus. In about two weeks time,
  his uncle reported that now everything is fine with the boy. </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN>A student of the Flower Medicine training class, a teacher
  by profession, enthusiastically reported an incident where one of her
  colleagues, after an unpleasant situation was in a state of excitement and
  rage without any control over himself. A dose of Rescue Remedy restored
  normalcy in him almost instantaneously. </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN>One day, a house wife was brought in a car and the time was
  around midnight. She was in a comatose condition. That evening there was a
  tense situation after a quarrel with some relatives, after which she became
  unconscious. Her husband after returning from his work took sometime to ease
  out the prevailing tension and then she was brought to my place. Rescue
  Remedy and Clematis were given which were to be administered alternately
  every fifteen minutes. One dose from each medicine was given and a third dose
  was not required. </span></p>
